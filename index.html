      Isn't that fantastic that you can create an almighty tree that fast? The least little bit can do so much. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. We're not trying to teach you a thing to copy. We're just here to teach you a technique, then let you loose into the world. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow.
